## Recommendations ðŸ“‹
* We recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/ "Overleaf") for editing your scientific paper. However, you can use any LaTex editor you want.
* If you are a non-English speaker, LaTeX can be configured to typeset in your language (with the babel package). Below is an example of a document in Spanish :
`\usepackage[Spanish]{babel}`
* It is recommended to use a reference and citation management tool, such as [JafRef](https://www.jabref.org/ "JafRef").
* If you don't need the table of contents you can skip.
